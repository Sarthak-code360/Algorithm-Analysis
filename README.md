# Algorithm-Analysis
For basic concept understanding

This repository is consist of basic DSA concepts for a CSE student.

All codes are written in cpp.

In this repo I had added many programs whose basic concept are nessary to learn like: -

1. (a) Linear Search:

		Time Complexity
			Best Case Complexity: O (1)
			Worst Case Complexity: O (n)

   (b) Binary Serach:
   		
		Time Complexity
			Best Case Complexity: O (1)
			Worst Case Complexity: O (log n)

2. Merge Sort:

		Time Complexity
			Best Case Complexity: O (n log n)
			Worst Case Complexity: O (n log n)

3. Quick Sort:
		
		Time Complexity
			Best Case Complexity: O (n log n)
			Worst Case Complexity: O (n^2)


4. Fractional/Greedy Knapsak:

		 Time Complexity -> O (N logN)

5. 0/1 / Dynamic Knapsak:

		Time Complexity
			O (N*W)
			   where'N' is the number of weight elements 
				'W' is the capacity of the knapsack

6. (a) Prism Algorithm:

		 Time Complexity -> O (E log V)
		 			where 'E' is Edge
					      'V' is Vertex

   (b) Kruskal Algorithm:
   		
		Time Complexity -> O (E log V)
					where 'E' is Edge
                                              'V' is Vertex
 
7. Dijkstra's Algorithm:

		Time Complexity -> O (E log V)
					where 'E' is Edge
                                              'V' is Vertex
